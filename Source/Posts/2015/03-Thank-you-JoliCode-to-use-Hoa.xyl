    <a href="https://www.humancoders.com/">HumanCoders</a> etc. JoliCode is especially
    famous in France because of their presence in a lot of conferences, talks and
    events, and their help in such events. We met them in the past at the
    <a href="http://hoa-project.net/Event/Phptour14.html">PHPTour 2014</a> by the
    way.</p>
    <p>Recently, JoliCode announced to us they use Hoa internally for some of their
    customers. Their
    <a href="http://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/Ruler">favorite library
    is <code>Hoa\Ruler</code></a>. It perfectly fits in existing applications
    written with <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> for instance.</p>
    <p>Because of the agency size and importance in France, we decided to add their
    logo on our homepage. JoliCode teamÂ : Welcome in the truster list and
    <strong>thank you for your confidence</strong>!</p>
